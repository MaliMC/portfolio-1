 <p> During this activity, I learned how to make a single LED light up using components like a breadboard, battery, and resistor. I learned that you must used a resistor so it could reduce the amount of current flow, or the LED light will blow up.

            var person = prompt("What's your name?");
            if (person == null || person == "") {
                  txt = "Hi no name! Welcome to my portfolio!";
            }
            else {
                  txt = "Hello " + person + "! Welcome to my portfolio!";
            }
            document.getElementById("promptAnswer").innerHTML = txt;
